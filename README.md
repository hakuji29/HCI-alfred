# 🍴 StreetBite: Bringing Street Food Indoors

## 📌 Introduction

Street food is a big part of many cultures around the world — known for being **tasty**, **cheap**, and **quick to get**. It offers a fun and unique way to explore local dishes, often enjoyed right on the streets.

However, while street food is loved for its flavor and affordability, **concerns about hygiene, cleanliness, and comfort** often make people hesitate to buy from roadside vendors. These worries can stop even the biggest street food fans from enjoying their favorite snacks.

## 🎯 Project Goal

This project is about creating a **restaurant** that brings the vibrant street food experience **indoors** — keeping all the bold flavors and excitement, but in a **cleaner, safer, and more comfortable** setting.

With this concept, we aim to:

- 🍢 Recreate popular street food dishes
- 🧼 Ensure a high standard of hygiene
- 🪑 Provide a cozy indoor atmosphere
- 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Make street food accessible to everyone

StreetBite offers a fresh take on local favorites, giving customers the **best of both worlds**: authentic street food taste with modern dining comfort.
